                                J.R Willet made the first ICO, which stands for Initial Coin Offering. In traditional finance (tradfi), there are barriers to fundraising. Legacy systems are slow because they have legacy software, rules, government oversight, old methods and bureaucracy to deal with.

                                Willet put up his Bitcoin wallet address in a forum along with the whitepaper to Mastercoin, those that wanted to invest could send funds to that wallet and they received the equivalent in the agreed price of Mastercoin.

Web2 relies on the legacy systems whereas Web3 can utilise tokens to send funds directly to the participant.

                                The best tech does not come from a top down approach of bosses telling developers what to do. It comes from the intrigue, experiement, curiosity and natural drive of the developer. Anyone that creates is an artist and the best art is from authenticity.

                                Web3 is decentralised and permissionless and as it does not navigate through centralised server’s participants cannot be censored. Making it distributed and robust, for example, decentralised storage systems help provide a sanctuary for data, another method of resistance against censorship.

                                Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer decentralised currency, when Ethereum became a working protocol it enabled decentralised apps. When Uniswap was created after receiving an Ethereum grant, it helped to greatly increase liquidity in the market and this saw the rise of decentralise finance (DeFi).
                            </p>

                                Participants can put their tokens into a liquidity pool, this helps facilitate trade on decentralise exchanges. The participants receive yield by putting tokens into the liquidity pool.
                            </p>
                            <p class="card-text text-custom-white text-center"> 
                                Those that host a node to help provide consensus on the network receive tokens.

                                Web3 helps the creator economy. The blockchain keeps your integrity, a creator can reach their audience directly, and patronage too can be direct.

                                Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to non-crypto natives may see NFTs as simply expensive JPEGs. That is misconstruing an example of NFT implementation. NFT in daily life will be more common than most think, a passport will be an NFT, dental records, health records, in video games.

                                This is because each NFT has a core code, an identifier that is unique to that NFT, the metadata is attached to the owner. This can be applied to real-estate, concert tickets, access to exclusive content, minting music, books, it can help charitable fundraisng and more. NFTs help track the provenance and integrity of the data.

                                As blockchain has become stronger in its application, traditional finance and decentralised crypto finance is converging and this will increase the fluidity of finance.

Private markets are worth around $15tn, the entire real estate market was worth $634.9tn at the start of 2024. If just a fraction of this comes on-chain it is more than that eclipses the crypto market cap.

                                Let’s take the example of a regulated fund in Luxembourg. There is data that is convoluted to get to. A management company, an appraiser, a depository, a custodian, an administrator, they may all be asking the same question to get particular data however to gain access to the information they each have to reinvent the wheel. They have to construct their own software, which is usually kept in-house and it goes through various processes.
