                              Move was the foundation to Facebook's Libra blockchain, this would have taken the company from a social media platform with billions of users to a massive, global spanning bank with a commodity basket. 
                            </p>>
                            <p class="card-text text-custom-golden text-center">
                              With such resources at its deposal, Facebook magnified the brainpower to devise Move, a Rust-based programming language. The potential was to enable people to pay for taxi's, send tips, purchase items, all sorts, through the app plus more and in order to do that the developer language had to be security focus. 
                            </p>>
                            <p class="card-text text-custom-golden text-center">
                              In the end, Libra became Diem and Diem died as USA authorities could not accept such a big tech firm taking over the dollar. Meanwhile, Facebook has rebranded to Meta and is taking on AI.
                              Nonetheless, the Move language has lived on and Lotus has risen.
                              With Lotus, our nature is collaborative, we are to benefit the ecosystem.

                              The focus of Lotus is to have a Layer-1 Move project that is regulatory safe and provide the environment for the space to build on.

                              The blockchain is not just a tool, it is an expression. One of a community wanting to launch a fair chain that fosters an ecosystem that seeks to pioneer and push crypto forward, one that wants to prove the power of decentralisation.
                            </p>>

                              We taking the chain from pre-0L Network V.7 and track our own course with Aptos-compatibility.
                              As cryptocurrency has become dominated by the venture capitalists, there is an opportunity to accomplish a rare feat. To progress the network and continue the ethos from pre-V7 0L, to create a community driven chain that provides a clean network for builders that had a fair launch through originally mining the protocol. We are open to contribution and as people have come into the server, we have opened up roles and input is most welcome. 
                            </p>>
                            <p class="card-text text-custom-golden text-center">
                              We have been assigning key roles, discussing how we can take further steps. People have been joining the community and we open up to community votes furthermore, there are working groups whitling away with participants progressing the network.

                              It is exciting as there is much room to blossom into. We will improve the transaction speed and optimise blockchain performance. As our community forms and builds, we can experiment, provide robust security, and we will branch out our partnership network, allowing Lotus to flourish.
